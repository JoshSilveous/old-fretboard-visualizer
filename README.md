# old-fretboard-visualizer
This is an old VanillaJS project I created around March 2022 while taking a JavaScript class. This class was my first introduction to JS.
I wanted a faster way to access different guitar scales, modes, and chords without having to look them up every time. So I made this.
This project catapulted me into an interest in Web Development and JavaScript.

You can find the deployment of this tool [here](https://old-fretboard-visualizer.vercel.app/)

**I have since abandoned this project.**

I made a second iteration of this idea, called MusiqTools, while I was learning React. The repository for MusiqTools can be found [here](https://github.com/JoshSilveous/musiqtools).

However, I also abandoned MusiqTools, as my structure used in the project became unmanageable. I ended up restarting again, equipped with more React experience, and created my third (and best) iteration of this idea, underwhelmingly titled **Guitar Visualizer**.
The GitHub Repo for this can be found [here](https://github.com/JoshSilveous/guitar-visualizer), and you can access the tool via [this deployment](https://guitar-visualizer.vercel.app/).

Again, there is a lot of redundant and unneccessary code here- so don't judge me :)
